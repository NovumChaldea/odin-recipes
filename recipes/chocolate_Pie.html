    <p>Triple chocolate mud pie. Experience pure choc indulgence with this rich fudge-filled, cookie-based dessert. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>250g packet choc ripple biscuits</ul>
    <ul>75g butter, melted</ul>
    <ul>1 1/2 x 180g blocks dark chocolate, chopped</ul>
    <ul>600ml thickened cream</ul>
    <ul>2 tbsp cocoa powder, sifted</ul>
    <ul>Dark chocolate curls, to serve</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>Process biscuits until fine crumbs. Add butter. Process until just combined. Press mixture over base and sides of 3cm deep, 23cm-round (base) loose-based fluted flan tin. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 150C/130C fan-forced.</ol>
    <ol>Meanwhile, make filling: Combine coffee and 1 tablespoon hot water in a bowl until smooth. Place chocolate, butter, sugar, coffee mixture and milk in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir for 3 to 4 minutes or until smooth and combined. Set aside for 20 minutes to cool. Whisk in cocoa and flours. Whisk in egg until combined.    </ol>
    <ol>Pour filling over biscuit base. Place tin on a baking tray (see note). Bake for 35 minutes or until top is firm to touch. Stand for 20 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Meanwhile, place chocolate and 1/2 cup cream in a heatproof, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on Medium-High (75%) for 1 to 2 minutes or until smooth, stirring halfway through cooking with a metal spoon. Spread 2/3 of the ganache over top of pie. Set aside for 20 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Meanwhile, using an electric mixer beat cocoa and remaining cream until soft peaks form. Serve pie topped with cream mixture, chocolate curls and drizzled with remaining ganache</ol>
